Yes, you read that right! Once upon a time I was translating legal documents and case reports, drowning in the *laws of people*, and now I spend my days 
venturing into the *laws of nature*, thinking about quantum particles, photons, and topological phases. You can say that somewhere along the way, Schrödinger replaced Kafka in my life! (~~though as a Kafka fangirl I can't claim this is entirely true!~~) 

Besides my now unfunctional law degree, I have a Bachelor’s in Physics (with a thesis on entanglement-based quantum key distribution) and a Master’s in Quantum Technologies (with a thesis on atmospheric effects on free-space QKD). But hey! Don't jump too quickly to the conclusion that I'm a *QKD girl*. My research interests also live in other areas where light and information meet.

When I’m not buried in LaTeX notes, simulations or debugging code that *should* work but doesn’t, I write, read, or play escape games (~~a Dark Dome fan here!~~) and puzzles. I also like hiking, though it’s not exactly a thing you can do in Alexandria (Egypt), so I went to Pakistan and Germany to hike instead. While there, I somehow found time to attend a summer school on quantum technologies and intern at the **Max Planck Institute for the Physics of Complex Systems** in my *spare* time. I also like cooking but I like eating even more. I went to Spain to try some original churros but I ended up stuck at the **CSIC** where I had to present my master's thesis work to be freed (i.e. graduate).

I'm an Arabic native speaker (obviously!) and I like from time to time to practice my written Arabic skills which have been buried under the rubble of my resignation from legal translation. I *voluntarily* lead the team of [Egypt Scholars Library](https://library.egyptscholars.org/), a platform we aspire to make a destination for the general Arab audience seeking accessible, high-quality scientific content.

I’m currently working on projects on quantum metrology and topological phases of matter, and exploring where I can take this curiosity next. I’m **interested in pursuing a PhD** where I can continue working on a relevant topic at the intersection of theory and experiment and make tangible contributions to real-world applications.
