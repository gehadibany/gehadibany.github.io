Yes, you read that right! Once upon a time I was translating legal documents and case reports, drowning in the laws of people, and now I spend my days 
venturing into the laws of nature, thinking about quantum particles, photons, and topological phases. You can say that somewhere along the way, Schrödinger replaced Kafka in my life! (~~though as a Kafka fangirl I can't claim this is entirely true!~~) 

Besides my now unfunctional law degree, I have a Bachelor’s in Physics (with a thesis on entanglement-based quantum key distribution) and a Master’s in Quantum Technologies (with a thesis on atmospheric effects on free-space QKD). But hey! Don't jump too quickly to the conclusion that I'm a *QKD girl*. My research interests also live also in other areas where light and information meet, from quantum sensing to topological materials.
