Education
======
* [M.Sc. in Quantum Technologies](https://qtep.csic.es/master-quantum-tech), UIMP & CSIC - Spain, 2025
  * Thesis: *Free-Space Quantum Key Distribution Under Atmospheric Fluctuations* (04/2025–09/2025)  
  * Investigated atmospheric transmission effects on QKD downlinks and optimizing operational parameters and the receiver.
  * Supervisor: Dr. Daniel Balado Souto & Dr Veronica Fernandez Marmol

* [B.Sc. in Physics](https://www.open.ac.uk/courses/physics/degrees/bsc-physics-r51), The Open University - UK, 2023
  * Thesis: *Review of Entanglement-Based Quantum Cryptography* (04/2023–08/2023)  
  * Explored entanglement-based QKD protocols, scalability challenges, and early implementations in satellite and network-based quantum communication.

* ~~LL.B., Alexandria University - Egypt, 2016~~


Research Experience
======
* 05/2025–Present: Research Intern  
  * Max Planck Institute for the Physics of Complex Systems (MPI-PKS), Dresden, Germany *(On-site from 05/2025 to 08/2025 and remotely afterwards)* 
  * Project: *Topological skyrmion semimetals*  
  * Supervisor: Dr. Ashley Cook
    * We are investigating a newly proposed topological phase of matter, the [topological skyrmion semimetal](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15753), and its generalizations. The project is built on previous work by the Correlations and Topology group. {% on a [multiplicative Weyl semimetal model](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.109.035147). Our goal is to generalize the classification of topological semimetals to phases characterized by skyrmionic or curvature-trace topology.%} 

* 08/2025–Present: Research Intern  
  * Nordic Institute for Theoretical Physics (Nordita)  
  * Project: *Quantum metrology in superconducting systems*  
  * Supervisor: Dr. Sofia Qvarfort
      * We are investigating how to leverage the non-linearity arising from the expansion of the potential of transmon-like Hamiltonians to increase the precision limits using quantum sensing theoretical tools.
